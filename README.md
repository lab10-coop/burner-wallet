Forked from https://github.com/austintgriffith/burner-wallet

This wallet has been radically chopped down to the most essential features, without any respect of keeping other functionalities alife, therefore it might not be a good canditate to start a fork from.

There are places in the world today where it's hard to find important goods with the traditional currency or the currency may fluctuate immensely in value due to inflation. Luckily, exchange of value is one of our most powerful assets in the Ethereum space.¬†

Unfortunately, it is especially difficult to onboard new users because our ecosystem has such a steep learning curve. Traditional wallets put a huge burden on the user to understand a new currency and deal with seed phrases.

What we need is a way to exchange an intuitive currency like DAI using a simple and ubiquitous platform like the mobile web¬†browser.

### Contributing as a Developer/Designer

```
git clone https://github.com/lab10-coop/burner-wallet.git
cd burner-wallet
```


initialize burner:
```
npx clevis init
```
(You'll need to hit enter a few times to specify some config directories.)

install burner:
```
npm i
```

in a new terminal start the app:
```
npm start
```

you probably want to have a bin alias for clevis in your .bashrc or .profile as mentioned in the [clevis docs](https://github.com/austintgriffith/clevis):
```
alias clevis='./node_modules/clevis/bin.js'
```

in a new terminal compile and deploy all contracts:
```
clevis test full
```

Take a look at `tests/clevis.js`, the `metamask()` function in particular, to give your MetaMask accounts some ETH when you run the full test.

Here are two phones exchanging value in a matter of seconds using burners:

![burnerwalletdemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2653167/48271785-5dcf5c80-e3fa-11e8-98fb-143de75df7aa.gif)

One mobile phone can send DAI to another in 5 seconds with a simple QR code scan without any wallet download, this works on web browsers. Users can even send value through messaging services like WhatsApp with a simple link!

The Burner Wallet runs on the xDai sidechain from POA. Since it is in DAI, a dApp can simply refer to amounts in USD. Plus, block times take 5 seconds and gas costs are virtually abstracted because they are so cheap and paid in DAI. Finally, the bridge between xDai and DAI/ETH is as simple as sending tokens to a specific address.¬†

A burner wallet is automatically generated upon visiting https://xdai.io and your private key is stored in a cookie so it will be there when you come back. However, you should sweep any value you hold to a cold wallet regularly and burn your ephemeral private key. A burner wallet is analogous to cash; you won't carry too much because it can be lost but it's astonishingly easy to exchange.¬†

This can also be very handy in everyday use even for the crypto-initiated. If you are share a Lyft or a pizza with a friend and want to split the cost, just shoot their QR code with your camera and it will open up a new burner wallet to exchange value with them. Just don't forget to sweep to cold storage and burn your key when you get home!

Here is a follow up video to show how to go from fiat to DAI to xDai and back:
